<p>On February 27th 2012, I will give a talk at the <strong><a href="http://www.javascript-conference.de/en/">JavaScript Conference</a></strong> in Düsseldorf, Germany. The sessions are focussed on HTML5-related APIs and JavaScript application architecture and will be held in English. The one-day conference aims at professional JavaScript developers, so the ticket fee is higher than community-driven meetups and BarCamps like the <a href="/mmt28/">Multimediatreff</a> I have recently spoken at.

<p>In my talk I will present insights we gained during the development of several <a href="http://backbonejs.org/">Backbone.js</a>-driven JavaScript applications like <a href="http://moviepilot.com/">Moviepilot.com</a> and <a href="http://salon.io/">Salon.io</a>. The official announcement of my talk:</p>

<blockquote>

<h2>JavaScript Application Architecture with Backbone.js</h2>

<p>Several JavaScript libraries which implement the Model-View-Controller pattern recently gained attention. Only few of these libraries offer a superstructure which manages the individual models, views and controllers. It’s easy to set up a simple MVC example, but an application with multiple complex interfaces will need a sophisticated overall architecture.</p>

<p>The talk will start with the popular Backbone.js library as a basis, discuss its shortcomings and present a field-tested application architecture. As an example, the talk will show how to implement an OAuth-based client-side login via Facebook, Twitter or Google.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Even if you can’t attend the conference, you don’t have to miss my presentation. The <a href="https://9elements.com/">9elements</a> and <a href="http://moviepilot.com/about">Moviepilot</a> developers are working hard to generalize the application structure of Moviepilot.com in order to release it as an open-source framework on <a href="http://github.com/">Github</a>. <em>Addendum: <a href="/chaplin/">Chaplin was released on February 24th</a>!</em></p>

<p>In addition, we’re documenting our conclusions about MVC application architecture in general and Backbone.js in particular. With these findings, we hope to move the JavaScript application development a bit forward. Stay tuned and watch out for announcements on <a href="https://9elements.com/io/">IO 9elements</a> and <a href="http://moviepilotlabs.tumblr.com/">Moviepilot Labs</a>.</p>
