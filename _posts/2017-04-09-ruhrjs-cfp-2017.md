In July 2016, [we’ve organized](/pottjs-and-progressive-enhancement/) **RuhrJS**, a lovely little conference on the JavaScript programming language and web development in [our home town Bochum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bochum), located in the [Ruhr Valley metro area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruhr). While this was our first big conference and we’re glad that speakers and attendees loved the friendly atmosphere mixed with technical talks.

This year we’re organizing RuhrJS for the second time. Not bigger, just better. The conference will be held on **October 14th and 15th, 2017** in Bochum, Germany.

## Speak at RuhrJS 2017

We’d love to hear you speak about JavaScript, web development or programming! You can **[propose a talk via PaperCall](https://www.papercall.io/ruhrjs2017)**. The call for proposals ends on April 16th.

The talks will be 30 minutes long and in English. There will be a blind voting on the submitted talks. Only the title and abstract will be used in the selection process. Talk proponents are notified in May whether their talk was selected.

RuhrJS is a community-driven, non-profit JavaScript conference. We cover travel and accommodation costs for speakers in case their employer does not sponsor the journey. Bochum is pretty easy to reach by plane and train. Unfortunately, we cannot pay a speaking fee.

If you are a first-time speaker or would like to improve your presentation skills or wish for technical feedback, we will connect you with an experienced mentor.

If you don’t want to present a topic yourself, but know someone who would be a perfect fit, you can nominate them by sending their  contact details to the RuhrJS team.

## Tickets

Last but not least, if you don’t want to give a talk, you’re still invited to attend our conference! Tickets will be **available in May**, starting at 200 € for students. Early-bird tickets cost 250 €, regular tickets 300 €. We will announce the next ticket batches [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/ruhrjs) and [via newsletter](https://ruhrjs.de/).

We are seeking ways to make our community more inclusive. That’s why we provide a certain amount of **free tickets** for people who can’t afford a ticket or belong to an under-represented group in tech. We hope our scholarship program can enable you to join us and contribute to our community! <a href="https://diversitytickets.org/events/69">Apply for a free ticket on DiversityTickets.org</a>.
