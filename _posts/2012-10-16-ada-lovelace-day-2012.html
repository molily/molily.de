<p>Today is <a href="http://findingada.com/">Ada Lovelace Day</a>, “<q>a day of blogging to draw attention to women excelling in technology</q>.” I participated before in 2009 and 2010, but for some reason I forgot to blog last year…</p>

<p>The women I payed my respect to in the last years are well-established today. <a href="http://rmurphey.com/">Rebecca Murphey</a> is one of the most notable JavaScripters in the world. <a href="http://lea.verou.me/">Lea Verou</a> is a well-known speaker, working for the W3C. <a href="http://blog.gingertech.net/">Silvia Pfeiffer</a> is now co-editor of the HTML5 specification, the most important technical standard for frontend devs like me. <a href="http://burningbird.net/">Shelley Powers</a>, a long-term JavaScript writer, wrote <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Learning-Node-Shelley-Powers/dp/1449323073">a book on Node.js</a>. <a href="http://fantasai.inkedblade.net/">fantasai</a> is rocking the <a href="http://www.w3.org/blog/CSS/">W3C CSS WG</a>, pushing out specifications to Candidate Recommendation. <a href="http://nimbupani.com/">Divya Manian</a> was hired by Opera and recently Adobe, doing developer evangelism and webstandards documentation. Just to name a few. No doubt that these women significantly contribute to web development and the community in general. I personally benefit from their work every day. And I’m grateful to work with people like <a href="http://tif.ca/">Tiffany Conroy</a>, like recently at the <a href="http://writing.jan.io/2012/07/22/jsfab.html">JavaScript for Absolute Beginners</a> workshop. Every day I discover more and more women in the field, marvelling at their blog articles and Github projects.</p>

<p>So who should I pick this year? In 2010 I picked eleven individuals, today I would need to name fifty at minimum. I could name <a href="http://garann.com/">Garann Means</a>, a JavaScript developer at Etsy, whose blog posts I love to read. And <a href="http://ireneros.com/">Irene Ros</a>, active in the Backbone.js community, working for <a href="http://www.bocoup.com/">Bocoup</a>. And <a href="http://maryrosecook.com/">Mary Rose Cook</a>, Indie game programmer (<a href="http://pistolslut.com/">Pistol Slut</a>, <a href="http://emptyblack.com/">Empty Black</a>) and author of <a href="http://androjs.maryrosecook.com/">Andro.js</a> and <a href="http://machinejs.maryrosecook.com/">Machine.js</a>. And <a href="http://jabberwocky.eu/">Elise Huard</a> who is bringing more functional programming and other CS wisdom into the JavaScript and Ruby world. And <a href="http://tiffanybbrown.com/">Tiffany B. Brown</a>, part of the <a href="http://my.opera.com/ODIN/blog/">Opera developer relations team</a>. And <a href="http://www.dira.ro/">Irina Dumitrascu</a>, who gave a powerful and motivating talk on Test-Driven Development at the <a href="http://apps.berlinjs.org">apps.berlin.js meetup</a> I’m co-organizing. And <a href="https://github.com/olado">Laura Doktorova</a>, who wrote the JavaScript templating engine <a href="http://olado.github.io/doT/">doT</a>. And so on.</p>

<p>Most of these women are well-accepted in the specific tech field they are involved in. They’re working for browser vendors or huge enterprises, <a href="http://2012.jsconf.eu/2012/09/17/beating-the-odds-how-we-got-25-percent-women-speakers.html">speaking at top-notch conferences</a>, writing books published by O’Reilly and such. That is, these few are already highly visible. Everyone in web dev who doesn’t close their eyes actively needs to recognize them. It’s clear that there are <em>excellent</em> female developers and computer scientists. But “Rebecca Murphey and Lea Verou can’t be everywhere at once”, as Garann Means once put it. It’s great to name inspiring role models who made it. It’s probably harder to actually make web development and programming accessible for everyone, on all levels. You don’t have to be <em>exceptionally</em> talented, self-confident or extroverted to deserve respect, visibility and of course a well-paid job in the industry. Nobody’s a natural in programming, but everyone should have the opportunity to enter the field and get the necessary support to advance. In addition to naming a few stars (well, they are stars for me) I’d like to draw attention to the thousands of female developers who aren’t as visible yet. I’d like to point to initiatives who help people to get into technology, web development and programming:</p>
