## RuhrJS JavaScript conference

On July 2nd and 3rd, the first international JavaScript conference in the [Ruhr Valley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruhr) took place: **[RuhrJS](http://ruhrjs.de)**. And we had a blast! The conference was hosted by my employer 9elements and mostly organized by my colleague [Madeleine](https://twitter.com/Maggysche). During the event, I was part of the “care bears”, taking care of the attendees’ safety and helping to enforce the [code of conduct](http://ruhrjs.de/#code-of-conduct).

We’re glad that all worked out well and the attendees enjoyed the conference. I’m happy to say that there will be another RuhrJS conference in 2017!

## PottJS talk on Progressive Enhancement

After having written several posts on progressive enhancement, I decided to speak about the topic to discuss practical questions regarding the usage of JavaScript. So I held a talk on progressive enhancement at the [PottJS meet-up group](http://pottjs.de) in July.

The slides of my talk are available in German:
