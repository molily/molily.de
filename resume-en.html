  <h2>Professional goals</h2>

  <p>In a strong partnership with clients and teammates, I seek to create useful, high-quality websites that communicate effectively and are pleasant to use. Websites that spread ideas, knowledge and opinions. Websites that come to life through their users and inspire them to shape the web.</p>

  <p>I support user-centered design, web standards and open data. I advocate for a sharing culture among clients, users, developers and experts from different fields. Every day I learn something new and share my knowledge – in discussions, articles and talks. I experiment with new concepts and technologies to write and speak about them. I create technical tutorials, documentations and references.</p>

  <p>I spread the idea of the web as diverse and vibrant medium with universal access. In my professional work I participate in the international web community, for example by contributing to open-source software.</p>
